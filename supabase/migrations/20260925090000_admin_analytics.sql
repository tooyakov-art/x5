-- Analytics for the admin dashboard.
--
-- Two things the product could not answer before: how many people actually open
-- the app, and where the credits go. Visits were never recorded at all, and
-- every usage table lives behind RLS that only lets a user see their own rows,
-- so the dashboard needs server-side aggregates instead of raw reads.
--
-- Every function below is SECURITY DEFINER and refuses anyone who is not in
-- public.is_x5_developer(). They return aggregates as JSON; no raw row of one
-- user is ever handed to another.
